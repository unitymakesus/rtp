Password protect WordPress pages and posts by user roles or with multiple passwords; protect your entire website with a single password.

== Description ==

Password Protect WordPress (PPWP) plugin offers a powerful and **all-in-one solution** to secure your website with passwords.

Whether you want to password protect WordPress categories, WooCommerce products, a few posts, or your entire website, PPWP plugin will help you do so with ease.

This plugin does not protect images or uploaded files so if you attach the media files to the protected pages or posts, they are still accessible to anyone with the link. Use [Prevent Direct Access Gold](https://preventdirectaccess.com/features/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=ref-link&utm_campaign=password-protect-page-lite) to block their direct file URL access.

Please note that the passwords will be stored in the post meta and this plugin will set a cookie to allow access to the protected pages or posts.

== Password Protected Features ==
The Lite version of Password Protect WordPress plugin offers the following features:

= Protect WordPress Pages & Posts with Multiple Passwords =
The plugin extends WordPress's built-in password protection feature by allowing you to set multiple passwords per Page and Post.

= Password Protect WordPress Pages & Posts by User Roles =
You can also password protect your WordPress Pages & Posts by user roles. In other words, you can set different passwords for different user roles, i.e. one for subscribers, one for editors role.

= Password's Cookies Expiration =
Users won't have to keep entering the password to access a protected page or post until its cookies expire. You can change the expiration time on the plugin's settings page.

= Password Protect The Entire WordPress Website =
You can password protect your whole WordPress website with a single password. All your website content including pages, posts and other custom post types (but not media files) are locked as well.

= Partial Content Protection =
Partial Content Protection feature allows you to [password protect certain sections](https://passwordprotectwp.com/features/password-protect-partial-content/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin_desc_link&utm_campaign=password-protect-page-lite) of a page or post instead of locking the entire content. This is useful to create teaser content which encourages visitors to register to unlock the entire post.

= Integrate with Page Builders =
Instead of using shortcode to protect part of content, you can use our built-in module on the most popular page builders including:

* Elementor
* Beaver Builder
* Divi Builder (WIP)
* Visual Composer (WIP)

These built-in modules allow you to set passwords, whitelisted roles, customize password forms and so on via our friendly User Interface. You no longer have to deal with the complex shortcode attributes.

= Global - Master Passwords =
When there are many password protected posts on your website, it becomes difficult and time-consuming to create or manage passwords for each content. That’s when master passwords come in handy.

Users will be able to [unlock all protected posts at once](https://passwordprotectwp.com/docs/master-passwords-unlock-all-protected-content/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_medium=plugin_desc_link&utm_campaign=password-protect-page-lite&utm_content=global-pwd) with just one master password.

Please note that this feature **does not** password protect all posts automatically. It simply allows you to use master passwords to unlock every post that you choose to password protect. Original passwords attached to each post will still be working, together with these master (global) passwords.

The master passwords feature also comes with an easy-to-use interface allowing you to create unlimited master passwords and manage all of them in one place. You will have full control to (de)activate, delete passwords as well as restrict usage passwords by usage, time and user role.

= Customize Password Form & Messages with WordPress Customizer =
Customize the password form text and design to match the look and feel of your website.

You will be able to change the WordPress default password protected error message as well as password form instruction, namely headline, description, password input placeholder, and button text.

The button and text’s font-size, color and background can also be customized through a friendly WYSIWYG HTML Editor.

= Show Password Protected Post Excerpt =
Many WordPress themes hide the post excerpt and featured image of password protected content by default. Enable this option to show excerpt of your password protect posts.

= Hide Password Protected Content =
By default, your password protected content will still show up on various pages such as home and category page once published.

This feature allows you to control the visibility of your protected post types in various different views:

* Hide posts from Recent Posts widgets
* Hide posts from Next & Previous link on the single post
* Hide posts on search results
* Hide posts from Yoast SEO Google XML Sitemaps, and RSS
* Hide posts on Front page, Author, and Archive pages including tag and category page
* Protected pages hidden from search results, home page & everywhere they're listed

Even though the posts are hidden, those who know the URL will still have access to the pages (but not the protected content).
