Fortunately, though WordPress doesn’t enable these functions out of the box, there’s a plugin you can use. Modern Events Calendar is an easy way to manage events of all kinds on your WordPress site. As the name suggests, the core benefit of Modern Events Calendar is that it lets you create an events calendar that looks pretty great out of the box. That latter part is important because some popular event calendar plugins require a lot of custom styling to make them look good, which is tough if you don’t know your way around CSS.

That latter part is important because some popular event calendar plugins require a lot of custom styling to make them look good, which is tough if you don’t know your way around CSS.

>If you are running an event website or you want to start a WordPress powered website with booking services, you need a managed WordPress hosting that will not disappoint you and a strong and practical plugin that can provide all the required features.

1- Set the date and time of your event. Also, you can set up your event during the whole day and without a specific time, or you can hide the end time from single events page; or both the start and end time.
Note: You can set event repeats and end repeat for your events here as well.
2- You can set an hourly schedule for your event. For example, if your event starts at 8 A.M. and continues until 6 P.M., then you can set an hourly schedule from 8 to 10, and specify the plan or content of these two hours. There is no limit for defining hourly schedules.
3- You can specify the venue, plus the name of the place, address, coordinates, etc.
4- Here, you can add external links and/or info links to your event so that when your users click on them, they’ll be directed to another page with extra information on the event.
5- Add your organizer here. You can then fill the form with the information of your organizer. This information includes name, phone number, email address, and website or link.
6- Add your event cost with its currency label here.

8- Here, you can add tickets for your event. You can create tickets with different titles; if you are going to sell tickets with different prices then this option is what you want.
Note: If you change the title to the name of a particular day, then the user will know on a certain day the price of the ticket is different.
9- Enter the information about Fees/Taxes.

= Can I customize the event pages? =

= Does MEC have default languages or it needs to be translated? =

Yes, for some of the languages MEC has the translation file as default. However, since these translations have been done by the users, they may be incomplete, hence updating them might be required. For more information, please [click here](https://webnus.net/dox/modern-events-calendar/translate-mec/).

= Can I have more than one calendar in one website? =

Unfortunately, MEC does not support more than 1 calendar in a single website, however, it will be added in its upcoming updates.

= Can I import/export from/to MEC? =

Yes, you can get an XML export from MEC data or import the file you've exported to MEC. Also, if you are using one of the following plugins (The event calendar, calendarize it, EventOn, Events Schedule WP Plugin), then you can easily transfer your events to MEC.

= Do I lose all my data or customization if I update MEC? =

If you’ve added a file to the main folder of MEC, this file will be removed after the update. Therefore, please do get a full back up before proceeding with the update process.
